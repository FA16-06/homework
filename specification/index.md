## Introduction

The White Table is a collaborative, recreational, and educational tool allowing a team or an individual to interact with a responsive display, all with the simple form factor of a coffee table.
With a touch sensitive display as the surface of the table, users can express their ideas visually by drawing or writing on the table.
The White Table simplifies business meetings by allowing rapid contributions by many individuals with equally rapid documentation saving images to be reviewed later.
The White Table allows individuals to casually doodle and sketch in the comfort of a living room.
The White Table augments tabletop gaming as the tabletop can become the game itself.
The White Table is just that, a table. When not in use, it retains its simple aesthetics as a table allowing its integration into nearly any setting.
The Whtite Table is the greatest evolution in table technology since Table Tennis

## Need

Team collaboration and documentation is a major challenge in all levels of industry and business.
White boards and paper leave much to be desired in terms of functionality as they do not integrate well into digital technologies.
The White Table proposes to allow rapid visual collaboration and documentation in the simple form factor of a table.
Multiple users could draw and write notes to share in real time, and the implementation as a table allows for ubiquitous versatility.
Currently there are no products on the market that have the proposed functionality of the White Table.
Collaborative touch displays exist but are likely too cost prohibitive to persuade adoption over traditional collaboration methods like white boards.
Furthermore, many existing products take on the form of wall mounted boards or lack a simple aesthetic preventing integration into casual settings.
Our customer desired this product as a means to easily draw and record his ideas to be easily shared.
Initially the target market is small businesses and teams looking for an easy way to collaborate.
The target market will hopefully be expanded to the household with the table as a recreational product.


## Summary

The White Table is an interactive touch display as the surface of a table allowing collaboration and recreation in any setting.
